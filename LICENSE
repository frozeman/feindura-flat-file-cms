GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore,
you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2)
offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.
For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems
will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in
the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL
to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.
To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces
specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging
a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement
a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used
to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries,
or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may
convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running
those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making
or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected
by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work
as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7
apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
    * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
    *     modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
    * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply,
    *     along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License
    *         gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that
    *     do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion
of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

    * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding
    *     Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
    * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer,
    *     valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone
    *         who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this
    *             License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
    *                 physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed
    *     only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
    * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
    *     Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along
    *         with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
    *             (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
    *                 object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
    *                     obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
    *     the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical
or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and
execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part
of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
(regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for
a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are
valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions,
but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    *     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    *     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
    * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
    *     contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it,
or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.
If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
apply either way.
8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable
means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely
as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License
grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization,
or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of
the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right
to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that
would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the
right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must
either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.
"Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country,
or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work,
and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy
of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a
party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based
on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered
work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies),
or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
available to you under applicable patent law.
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms
that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy
both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under
version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License
will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.
14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
"or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

Deutsche Übersetzung der Version 3, 29. Juni 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. (http://fsf.org/) 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

Es ist jedermann gestattet, diese Lizenzurkunde zu vervielfältigen und unveränderte Kopien zu verbreiten; Änderungen sind jedoch nicht erlaubt.

Diese Übersetzung ist kein rechtskräftiger Ersatz für die englischsprachige Originalversion!
Vorwort

Die GNU General Public License  die Allgemeine Öffentliche GNU-Lizenz  ist eine freie Copyleft-Lizenz für Software und andere Arten von Werken.

Die meisten Lizenzen für Software und andere nutzbaren Werke sind daraufhin entworfen worden, Ihnen die Freiheit zu nehmen,
die Werke mit anderen zu teilen und zu verändern. Im Gegensatz dazu soll Ihnen die GNU General Public License die Freiheit garantieren,
alle Versionen eines Programms zu teilen und zu verändern. Sie soll sicherstellen, daß die Software für alle ihre Benutzer frei bleibt.
Wir, die Free Software Foundation, nutzen die GNU General Public License für den größten Teil unserer Software; sie gilt außerdem für jedes andere Werk,
dessen Autoren es auf diese Weise freigegeben haben. Auch Sie können diese Lizenz auf Ihre Programme anwenden.

Wenn wir von freier Software sprechen, so beziehen wir uns auf Freiheit, nicht auf den Preis. Unsere Allgemeinen Öffentlichen Lizenzen sind darauf angelegt,
sicherzustellen, daß Sie die Freiheit haben, Kopien freier Software zu verbreiten (und dafür etwas zu berechnen, wenn Sie möchten), die Möglichkeit,
daß Sie die Software als Quelltext erhalten oder den Quelltext auf Wunsch bekommen, daß Sie die Software ändern oder Teile davon in neuen freien Programmen
verwenden dürfen und daß Sie wissen, daß Sie dies alles tun dürfen.

Um Ihre Rechte zu schützen, müssen wir andere daran hindern, Ihnen diese Rechte zu verweigern oder Sie aufzufordern, auf diese Rechte zu verzichten.
Aus diesem Grunde tragen Sie eine Verantwortung, wenn Sie Kopien der Software verbreiten oder die Software verändern: die Verantwortung,
die Freiheit anderer zu respektieren.

Wenn Sie beispielsweise die Kopien eines solchen Programms verbreiten  kostenlos oder gegen Bezahlung  müssen Sie an die Empfänger dieselben
Freiheiten weitergeben, die Sie selbst erhalten haben. Sie müssen sicherstellen, daß auch die Empfänger die Software im Quelltext erhalten bzw.
den Quelltext erhalten können. Und Sie müssen ihnen diese Bedingungen zeigen, damit sie ihre Rechte kennen.

Software-Entwickler, die die GNU GPL nutzen, schützen Ihre Rechte in zwei Schritten: (1) Sie machen ihr Urheberrecht (Copyright) auf die Software
geltend, und (2) sie bieten Ihnen diese Lizenz an, die Ihnen das Recht gibt, die Software zu vervielfältigen, zu verbreiten und/oder zu verändern.

Um die Entwickler und Autoren zu schützen, stellt die GPL darüberhinaus klar, daß für diese freie Software keinerlei Garantie besteht.
Um sowohl der Anwender als auch der Autoren Willen erfordert die GPL, daß modifizierte Versionen der Software als solche gekennzeichnet werden,
damit Probleme mit der modifizierten Software nicht fälschlicherweise mit den Autoren der Originalversion in Verbindung gebracht werden.

Manche Geräte sind daraufhin entworfen worden, ihren Anwendern zu verweigern, modifizierte Versionen der darauf laufenden Software
zu installieren oder laufen zu lassen, wohingegen der Hersteller diese Möglichkeit hat. Dies ist grundsätzlich unvereinbar mit dem Ziel,
die Freiheit der Anwender zu schützen, die Software zu modifizieren. Derartige gezielte mißbräuchliche Verhaltensmuster finden auf
dem Gebiet persönlicher Gebrauchsgegenstände statt  also genau dort, wo sie am wenigsten akzeptabel sind. Aus diesem Grunde wurde
diese Version der GPL daraufhin entworfen, diese Praxis für diese Produkte zu verbieten. Sollten derartige Probleme substantiell
auf anderen Gebieten auftauchen, sind wir bereit, diese Regelung auf diese Gebiete auszudehnen, soweit dies notwendig ist,
um die Freiheit der Benutzer zu schützen.

Schließlich und endlich ist jedes Computerprogramm permanent durch Software-Patente bedroht. Staaten sollten es nicht zulassen,
daß Patente die Entwicklung und Anwendung von Software für allgemein einsetzbare Computer einschränken, aber in Staaten,
wo dies geschieht, wollen wir die spezielle Gefahr vermeiden, daß Patente dazu verwendet werden, ein freies Programm im Endeffekt proprietär zu machen.
Um dies zu verhindern, stellt die GPL sicher, daß Patente nicht verwendet werden können, um das Programm nicht-frei zu machen.

Es folgen die präzisen Bedingungen für das Kopieren, Verbreiten und Modifizieren.
LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN
0. Definitionen

"Diese Lizenz" bezieht sich auf die Version 3 der GNU General Public License.

Mit "Urheberrecht" sind auch urheberrechtähnliche Rechte gemeint, die auf andere Arten von Werken Anwendung finden,
beispielsweise auf Fotomasken in der Halbleitertechnologie.

"Das Programm" bezeichnet jedes urheberrechtlich schützbare Werk, das unter diese Lizenz gestellt wurde.
Jeder Lizenznehmer wird als "Sie" angeredet. "Lizenznehmer" und "Empfänger" können natürliche oder rechtliche Personen sein.

Ein Werk zu "modifizieren" bedeutet, aus einem Werk zu kopieren oder es ganz oder teilweise auf eine Weise umzuarbeiten,
die eine urheberrechtliche Erlaubnis erfordert und kein Eins-zu-eins-Kopieren darstellt. Das daraus hervorgehende Werk wird als "modifizierte Version"
des früheren Werks oder als auf dem früheren Werk "basierendes" Werk bezeichnet.

Ein "betroffenes Werk" bezeichnet entweder das unmodifizierte Programm oder ein auf dem Programm basierendes Werk.

Ein Werk zu "propagieren" bezeichnet jedwede Handlung mit dem Werk, für die man, wenn unerlaubt begangen,
wegen Verletzung anwendbaren Urheberrechts direkt oder indirekt zur Verantwortung gezogen würde, ausgenommen
das Ausführen auf einem Computer oder das Modifizieren einer privaten Kopie. Unter das Propagieren eines Werks
fallen Kopieren, Weitergeben (mit oder ohne Modifikationen), öffentliches Zugänglichmachen und in manchen Staaten noch weitere Tätigkeiten.

Ein Werk zu "übertragen" bezeichnet jede Art von Propagation, die es Dritten ermöglicht, das Werk zu kopieren oder Kopien zu erhalten.
Reine Interaktion mit einem Benutzer über ein Computer-Netzwerk ohne Übergabe einer Kopie ist keine Übertragung.

Eine interaktive Benutzerschnittstelle zeigt "angemessene rechtliche Hinweise" in dem Umfang,
daß sie eine zweckdienliches und deutlich sichtbare Funktion bereitstellt, die (1) einen angemessenen Copyright-Vermerk zeigt und (2) dem Benutzer mitteilt,
daß keine Garantie für das Werk besteht (ausgenommen in dem Umfang, in dem Garantie gewährt wird),
daß Lizenznehmer das Werk gemäß dieser Lizenz übertragen dürfen und wie man ein Exemplar dieser Lizenz zu Gesicht bekommen kann.
Wenn die Benutzerschnittstelle eine Liste von Benutzerkommandos oder Optionen anzeigt, zum Beispiel ein Menü, dann erfüllt
ein deutlich sichtbarer Punkt in dieser Liste dieses Kriterium.
1. Quelltext

Der "Quelltext" eines Werkes bezeichnet diejenige Form des Werkes, die für Bearbeitungen vorzugsweise verwendet wird. "Objekt-Code"
bezeichnet jede Nicht-Quelltext-Form eines Werks.

Eine "Standardschnittstelle" bezeichnet eine Schnittstelle, die entweder ein offizieller Standard eines anerkannten Standardisierungsgremiums ist oder 
im Falle von Schnittstellen, die für eine spezielle Programmiersprache spezifiziert wurden  eine Schnittstelle, die unter Entwicklern,
die in dieser Programmiersprache arbeiten, weithin gebräuchlich ist.

Die "Systembibliotheken" eines ausführbaren Werks enthalten alles, ausgenommen das Werk als Ganzes, was (a) normalerweise zum Lieferumfang einer Hauptkomponente gehört,
aber selbst nicht die Hauptkomponente ist, und (b) ausschließlich dazu dient, das Werk zusammen mit der Hauptkomponente benutzen zu können
oder eine Standardschnittstelle zu implementieren, für die eine Implementation als Quelltext öffentlich erhältlich ist. Eine "Hauptkomponente"
bezeichnet in diesem Zusammenhang eine größere wesentliche Komponente (Betriebssystemkern, Fenstersystem usw.) des spezifischen Betriebssystems
(soweit vorhanden), auf dem das ausführbare Werk läuft, oder des Compilers, der zur Erzeugung des Objekt-Codes eingesetzt wurde, oder des für die
Ausführung verwendeten Objekt-Code-Interpreters.

Der "korrespondierende Quelltext" eines Werks in Form von Objekt-Code bezeichnet den vollständigen Quelltext, der benötigt wird, um das Werk zu
erzeugen, es zu installieren, um (im Falle eines ausführbaren Werks) den Objekt-Code auszuführen und um das Werk zu modifizieren, einschließlich
der Skripte zur Steuerung dieser Aktivitäten. Er schließt jedoch nicht die Systembibliotheken, allgemein einsetzbare Werkzeuge oder allgemein
erhältliche freie Computerprogramme mit ein, die in unmodifizierter Form verwendet werden, um die o.a. Tätigkeiten durchzuführen, die aber nicht Teil des Werks sind.
Zum Beispiel enthält der korrespondierende Quelltext die zum Programmquelltext gehörenden Schnittstellendefinitionsdateien sowie die Quelltexte von
dynamisch eingebundenen Bibliotheken und Unterprogrammen, auf die das Werk konstruktionsbedingt angewiesen ist, beispielsweise durch komplexe Datenkommunikation
oder Ablaufsteuerung zwischen diesen Unterprogrammen und anderen Teilen des Werks.

Der korrespondierende Quelltext braucht nichts zu enthalten, das der Anwender aus anderen Teilen des korrespondierenden Quelltextes automatisch regenerieren kann.

Der korrespondierende Quelltext eines Werks in Quelltextform ist das Werk selbst.
2. Grundlegende Genehmigungen

Alle unter dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte werden gewährt auf Grundlage des Urheberrechts an dem Programm, und sie sind unwiderruflich,
solange die festgelegten Bedingungen erfüllt sind. Diese Lizenz erklärt ausdrücklich Ihr uneingeschränktes Recht zur Ausführung des unmodifizierten Programms.
Die beim Ausführen eines betroffenen Werks erzeugten Ausgabedaten fallen unter diese Lizenz nur dann, wenn sie, in Anbetracht ihres Inhalts,
ein betroffenes Werk darstellen. Diese Lizenz erkennt Ihr im Urheberrecht vorgesehenes Recht auf angemessene Benutzung  oder seine Entsprechung  an.

Sie dürfen betroffene Werke, die Sie nicht übertragen, uneingeschränkt erzeugen, ausführen und propagieren, solange Ihre Lizenz ansonsten in Kraft bleibt.
Sie dürfen betroffene Werke an Dritte übertragen für den einzigen Zweck, Modifikationen exklusiv für Sie durchzuführen oder Einrichtungen für Sie bereitzustellen,
um diese Werke auszuführen, vorausgesetzt, Sie erfüllen alle Bedingungen dieser Lizenz für das Übertragen von Material, dessen Urheberrecht nicht bei Ihnen liegt.
Diejenigen, die auf diese Weise betroffene Werke für Sie anfertigen oder ausführen, müssen dies ausschließlich in Ihrem Namen tun,
unter Ihrer Anleitung und Kontrolle und unter Bedingungen, die ihnen verbieten, außerhalb ihrer Beziehung zu Ihnen weitere Kopien
Ihres urheberrechtlich geschützten Materials anzufertigen.

Übertragung ist in jedem Fall ausschließlich unter den unten aufgeführten Bedingungen gestattet. Unterlizensierung ist nicht gestattet, ist aber wegen §10 unnötig.
3. Schutz von Anwenderrechten vor Umgehungsverbotgesetzen

Kein betroffenes Werk darf als Teil eines wirksamen technischen Mechanismus' unter jedwedem anwendbarem Recht betrachtet werden,
das die Auflagen von Artikel 11 des am 20. Dezember 1996 verabschiedeten WIPO-Urheberrechtsvertrags oder unter vergleichbaren Gesetzen,
die die Umgehung derartiger Mechanismen verbietet oder einschränkt.

Wenn Sie ein betroffenes Werk übertragen, verzichten Sie auf jedes Recht, die Umgehung technischer Mechanismen zu verbieten,
insoweit diese Umgehung durch die Ausübung der von dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte in bezug auf das betroffene Werk herbeigeführt wird,
und Sie weisen jede Absicht von sich, die Benutzung oder Modifikation des Werks zu beschränken, um Ihre Rechtsansprüche oder Rechtsansprüche Dritter
zum Verbot der Umgehung technischer Mechanismen gegen die Anwender des Werks durchzusetzen.
4. Unveränderte Kopien

Sie dürfen auf beliebigen Medien unveränderte Kopien des Quelltextes des Programms, wie sie ihn erhalten, übertragen,
sofern Sie auf deutliche und angemessene Weise auf jeder Kopie einen angemessenen Urheberrechts-Vermerk veröffentlichen,
alle Hinweise intakt lassen, daß diese Lizenz und sämtliche gemäß §7 hinzugefügten Einschränkungen auf den Quelltext anwendbar sind,
alle Hinweise auf das Nichtvorhandensein einer Garantie intakt lassen und allen Empfängern gemeinsam mit dem Programm ein Exemplar dieser Lizenz zukommen lassen.

Sie dürfen für jede übertragene Kopie ein Entgelt  oder auch kein Entgelt  verlangen, und Sie dürfen Kundendienst- oder Garantieleistungen gegen Entgelt anbieten.
5. Übertragung modifizierter Quelltextversionen

Sie dürfen ein auf dem Programm basierendes Werk oder die nötigen Modifikationen, um es aus dem Programm zu generieren,
kopieren und übertragen in Form von Quelltext unter den Bestimmungen von §4, vorausgesetzt, daß Sie zusätzlich alle im folgenden genannten Bedingungen erfüllen:

a) 	Das veränderte Werk muß auffällige Vermerke tragen, die besagen, daß Sie es modifiziert haben, und die ein darauf bezogenes Datum angeben.
b) 	Das veränderte Werk muß auffällige Vermerke tragen, die besagen, daß es unter dieser Lizenz einschließlich der gemäß §7 hinzugefügten Bedingungen herausgegeben wird.
Diese Anforderung wandelt die Anforderung aus §4 ab, "alle Hinweise intakt zu lassen".
c) 	Sie müssen das Gesamtwerk als Ganzes gemäß dieser Lizenz an jeden lizensieren, der in den Besitz einer Kopie gelangt.
Diese Lizenz wird daher  ggf. einschließlich zusätzlicher Bedingungen gemäß §7  für das Werk als Ganzes und alle seine Teile gelten, unabhängig davon,
wie diese zusammengepackt werden. Diese Lizenz erteilt keine Erlaubnis, das Werk in irgendeiner anderen Weise zu lizensieren,
setzt aber eine derartige Erlaubnis nicht außer Kraft, wenn Sie sie diese gesondert erhalten haben.
d) 	Wenn das Werk über interaktive Benutzerschnittstellen verfügt, müssen diese jeweils angemessene rechtliche Hinweise anzeigen.
Wenn allerdings das Programm interaktive Benutzerschnittstellen hat, die keine angemessenen rechtlichen Hinweise anzeigen,
braucht Ihr Werk nicht dafür zu sorgen, daß sie dies tun.

Die Zusammenstellung eines betroffenen Werks mit anderen gesonderten und unabhängigen Werken, die nicht ihrer Natur nach Erweiterungen des betroffenen
Werks sind und die nicht mit ihm in einer Weise kombiniert sind, um ein größeres Programm zu bilden, in oder auf einem Speicher- oder
Verbreitungsmedium wird als "Aggregat" bezeichnet, wenn die Zusammenstellung und das sich für sie ergebende Urheberrecht nicht dazu verwendet werden,
den Zugriff oder die Rechte der Benutzer der Zusammenstellung weiter einzuschränken, als dies die einzelnen Werke erlauben.
Die Aufnahme des betroffenen Werks in ein Aggregat sorgt nicht dafür, daß diese Lizenz auf die anderen Teile des Aggregats wirke.
6. Übertragung in Nicht-Quelltext-Form

Sie dürfen ein betroffenes Werk in Form von Objekt-Code unter den Bedingungen der Paragraphen 4 und 5 kopieren und übertragen  vorausgesetzt,
daß Sie außerdem den maschinenlesbaren korrespondierenden Quelltext unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz übertragen auf eine der folgenden Weisen:

a) 	Sie übertragen den Objekt-Code in einem physikalischen Produkt (einschließlich ein physikalisches Speichermedium) gemeinsam mit
dem korrespondierenden Quelltext, der sich unveränderlich auf einem haltbaren physikalischen Medium befindet, das üblicherweise für
den Austausch von Software verwendet wird.
b) 	Sie übertragen den Objekt-Code in einem physikalischen Produkt (einschließlich ein physikalisches Speichermedium) gemeinsam mit
einem schriftlichen Angebot, das mindestens drei Jahre lang gültig sein muß und so lange, wie Sie Ersatzteile und Kundendienst für dieses Produktmodell anbieten,
jedem, der im Besitz des Objekt-Codes ist, entweder (1) eine Kopie des korrespondierenden Quelltextes der gesamten Software,
die in dem Produkt enthalten und von dieser Lizenz betroffen ist, zur Verfügung zu stellen  auf einem haltbaren physikalischen Medium,
das üblicherweise für den Austausch von Software verwendet wird, und zu nicht höheren Kosten als denen,
die begründbar durch den physikalischen Vorgang der Übertragung des Quelltextes anfallen, oder (2) kostenlosen Zugriff, um den korrespondierenden Quelltext von einem Netzwerk-Server zu kopieren.
c) 	Sie übertragen Kopien des Objekt-Codes gemeinsam mit einer Kopie des schriftlichen Angebots, den korrespondierenden Quelltext
zur Verfügung zu stellen. Diese Alternative ist nur für gelegentliche, nicht-kommerzielle Übertragung zulässig und nur,
wenn Sie den Objekt-Code als mit einem entsprechenden Angebot gemäß Absatz 6b erhalten haben.
d)

Sie übertragen den Objekt-Code dadurch, daß Sie Zugriff auf eine dafür vorgesehene Stelle gewähren,
und bieten gleichwertigen Zugriff auf den korrespondierenden Quelltext auf gleichem Weg auf dieselbe Stelle und ohne zusätzliche Kosten.
Sie müssen nicht von den Empfängern verlangen, den korrespondierenden Quelltext gemeinsam mit dem Objekt-Code zu kopieren.
Wenn es sich bei der für das Kopieren vorgesehenen Stelle um einen Netzwerk-Server handelt,
darf sich der korrespondierende Quelltext auf einem anderen Server befinden (von Ihnen oder von einem Dritten betrieben),
der gleichwertige Kopiermöglichkeiten unterstützt  vorausgesetzt Sie legen dem Objekt-Code klare Anleitungen bei,
die besagen, wo der korrespondierende Quelltext zu finden ist. Unabhängig davon, welcher Netzwerk-Server den korrespondierenden Quelltext beherbergt,
bleiben Sie verpflichtet, sicherzustellen, daß dieser lange genug bereitgestellt wird, um diesen Bedingungen zu genügen.
e) 	Sie übertragen den Objekt-Code unter Verwendung von Peer-To-Peer-Übertragung  vorausgesetzt, Sie informieren andere Teilnehmer darüber,
wo der Objekt-Code und der korrespondierende Quelltext des Werks unter den Bedingungen von Absatz 6d öffentlich und kostenfrei angeboten werden.

Ein abtrennbarer Anteil des Objekt-Codes, dessen Quelltext von dem korrespondierenden Quelltext als Systembibliothek ausgeschlossen ist,
braucht bei der Übertragung des Werks als Objekt-Code nicht miteinbezogen zu werden.

Ein "Benutzerprodukt" ist entweder (1) ein "Endbenutzerprodukt", womit ein materieller persönlicher Besitz gemeint ist,
der normalerweise für den persönlichen oder familiären Gebrauch oder im Haushalt eingesetzt wird, oder (2) alles,
was für den Einbau in eine Wohnung hin entworfen oder dafür verkauft wird. Bei der Entscheidung, ob ein Produkt ein Endbenutzerprodukt ist,
sollen Zweifelsfälle als erfaßt gelten. Wenn ein spezieller Anwender ein spezielles Produkt erhält, bezeichnet "normalerweise einsetzen"
eine typische oder weitverbreitete Anwendung dieser Produktklasse, unabhängig vom Status des speziellen Anwenders oder der Art und Weise,
wie der spezielle Anwender des spezielle Produkt tatsächlich einsetzt oder wie von ihm erwartet wird, daß er es einsetzt.
Ein Produkt gilt als Endbenutzerprodukt unabhängig davon, ob es substantiellen kommerziellen, industriellen oder nicht-endbenutzerspezifischen Nutzen hat,
es sei denn, dieser Nutzen stellt das einzige signifikante Anwendungsgebiet des Produkts dar.

Mit "Installationsinformationen" für ein Benutzerprodukt sind jedwede Methoden, Prozeduren, Berechtigungsschlüssel oder andere informationen gemeint,
die notwendig sind, um modifizierte Versionen eines betroffenen Werks, die aus einer modifizierten Version seines korrespondierenden Quelltextes hervorgegangen sind,
auf dem Produkt zu installieren und auszuführen. Die Informationen müssen ausreichen, um sicherzustellen, daß das Weiterfunktionieren
des modifizierten Objekt-Codes in keinem Fall verhindert oder gestört wird aus dem einzigen Grunde, weil Modifikationen vorgenommen worden sind.

Wenn Sie Objekt-Code gemäß diesem Paragraphen innerhalb oder zusammen mit oder speziell für den Gebrauch innerhalb eines Benutzerprodukts
übertragen und die Übertragung als Teil einer Transaktion stattfindet, in der das Recht auf den Besitz und die Benutzung des Benutzerprodukts
dauerhaft auf den Empfänger übergeht (unabhängig davon, wie diese Transaktion charakterisiert ist), müssen dem gemäß diesem Paragraphen
mitübertragenen korrespondierenden Quelltext die Installationsinformationen beiliegen. Diese Anforderung gilt jedoch nicht, wenn weder
Sie noch irgendeine Drittpartei die Möglichkeit behält, modifizierten Objekt-Code auf dem Benutzerprodukt zu installieren
(zum Beispiel, wenn das Werk in einem ROM installiert wurde).

Die Anforderung, Installationsinformationen bereitzustellen, schließt keine Anforderung mit ein, weiterhin Kundendienst,
Garantie oder Updates für ein Werk bereitzustellen, das vom Empfänger modifiziert oder installiert worden ist,
oder für das Benutzerprodukt, in dem das Werk modifiziert oder installiert worden ist. Der Zugriff auf ein Computer-Netzwerk darf verweigert werden,
wenn die Modifikation selbst die Funktion des Netzwerks grundlegend nachteilig beeinflußt oder wenn sie die Regeln und Protokolle
für die Kommunikation über das Netzwerk verletzt.

Der korrespondierende Quelltext und die Installationsinformationen, die in Übereinstimmung mit diesem Paragraphen übertragen werden,
müssen in einem öffentlich dokumentierten Format vorliegen (für das eine Implementation in Form von Quelltext öffentlich zugänglich ist),
und sie dürfen keine speziellen Passwörter oder Schlüssel für das Auspacken, Lesen oder Kopieren erfordern.
7. Zusätzliche Bedingungen

"Zusätzliche Genehmigungen" sind Bedingungen, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz ergänzen, indem sie Ausnahmen von einer oder mehreren Auflagen zulassen.
Zusätzliche Genehmigungen zur Anwendung auf das gesamte Programm sollen so betrachtet werden, als wären sie in dieser Lizenz enthalten,
soweit dies unter anwendbarem Recht zulässig ist. Wenn zusätzliche Genehmigungen nur für einen Teil des Programms gelten,
darf dieser Teil separat unter diesen Genehmigungen verwendet werden; das gesamte Programm jedoch unterliegt weiterhin
dieser Lizenz ohne Beachtung der zusätzlichen Genehmigungen.

Ungeachtet jeglicher anderer Regelungen dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie für Material, das Sie einem betroffenen Werk hinzufügen
(sofern Sie durch die Urheberrechtsinhaber dieses Materials autorisiert sind), die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz um folgendes ergänzen:

a) 	Gewährleistungsausschluß oder Haftungsbegrenzung abweichend von §§15 und 16 dieser Lizenz oder
b) 	die Anforderung, spezifizierte sinnvolle rechtliche Hinweise oder Autorenschaftshinweise in diesem Material oder in
den angemessenen rechtlichen Hinweisen, die von den sie enthaltenen Werken angezeigt werden, zu erhalten, oder
c) 	das Verbot, die Herkunft des Materials falsch darzustellen oder die Anforderung, daß modifizierte Versionen des
Materials auf angemessens Weise als vom Original verschieden markiert werden, oder
d) 	Begrenzung der Verwendung der Namen von Lizenzgebern oder Autoren des Materials für Werbezwecke oder
e) 	das Zurückweisen der Einräumung von Rechten gemäß dem Markenrecht zur Benutzung gewisser Produktnamen, Produkt- oder Service-Marken oder
f) 	die Erfordernis der Freistellung des Lizenznehmers und der Autoren des Materials durch jeden, der die Software
(oder modifizierte Versionen davon) überträgt, mit vertraglichen Prämissen der Verantwortung gegenüber dem Empfänger für jede Verantwortung,
die diese vertraglichen Prämissen diesen Lizenzgebern und Autoren direkt auferlegen.

Alle anderen hinzugefügten einschränkenden Bedingungen werden als "zusätzliche Einschränkungen" im Sinne von §10 betrachtet.
Wenn das Programm, wie Sie es erhalten haben, oder ein Teil davon dieser Lizenz untersteht zuzüglich einer weiteren Bedingung,
die eine zusätzliche Einschränkung darstellt, dürfen Sie diese Bedingung entfernen. Wenn ein Lizenzdokument eine zusätzliche Einschränkung enthält,
aber die Relizensierung unter dieser Lizenz erlaubt, dürfen Sie dem betroffenen Werk Material hinzufügen,
das den Bedingungen jenes Lizenzdokuments unterliegt, unter der Voraussetzung, daß die zusätzlichen Einschränkungen
bei einer derartigen Relizensierung oder Übertragung verfallen.

Wenn Sie einem betroffenen Werk in Übereinstimmung mit diesem Paragraphen Bedingungen hinzufügen, müssen Sie in den betroffenen
Quelltextdateien eine Aufstellung der zusätzlichen Bedingungen plazieren, die auf diese Quelltextdatei Anwendung finden,
oder einen Hinweis darauf, wo die Zusätzlichen Bedingungen zu finden sind.

Zusätzliche Bedingungen, seien es Genehmigungen oder Einschränkungen, dürfen in Form einer separaten schriftlichen Lizenz
oder in Form von Ausnahmen festgelegt werden; die o.a. Anforderungen gelten in jedem Fall.
8. Kündigung

Sie dürfen das Programm nicht verbreiten oder modifizieren, sofern es nicht durch diese Lizenz ausdrücklich gestattet ist.
Jeder anderweitige Versuch der Verbreitung oder Modifizierung ist nichtig und beendet automatisch Ihre Rechte unter dieser Lizenz
(einschließlich aller Patentlizenzen gemäß §11 Abs. 3).

Wenn Sie jedoch alle Verletzungen dieser Lizenz beenden, wird Ihre Lizenz durch einen speziellen Urheberrechtsinhaber wiederhergestellt,
und zwar (a) vorübergehend, solange nicht bzw. bis der Rechteinhaber Ihre Lizenz ausdrücklich und endgültig kündigt, und (b) dauerhaft,
sofern es der Rechteinhaber versäumt, Sie auf sinnvolle Weise auf die Lizenzverletzung innerhalb von 60 Tagen ab deren Beendigung hinzuweisen.

Darüberhinaus wird Ihre Lizenz durch einen speziellen Urheberrechtsinhaber permanent wiederhergestellt,
wenn Sie der Rechteinhaber auf sinnvolle Weise auf die Verletzung hinweist, wenn außerdem dies das erste Mal ist,
daß Sie auf die Verletzung dieser Lizenz (für jedes Werk) des Rechteinhabers hingewiesen werden, und wenn Sie die Verletzung innerhalb
von 30 Tagen ab dem Eingang des Hinweises einstellen.

Die Beendigung Ihrer Rechte unter dieser Lizenz beendet nicht die Lizenzen Dritter, die von Ihnen Kopien oder Rechte
unter dieser Lizenz erhalten haben. Wenn Ihre Rechte beendet und nicht dauerhaft wiederhergestellt worden sind,
sind Sie nicht berechtigt, neue Lizenzen für dasselbe Material gemäß §10 zu erhalten.
9. Annahme der Lizenz keine Voraussetzung für den Besitz von Kopien

Um eine Kopie des Programms auszuführen, ist es nicht erforderlich, daß Sie diese Lizenz annehmen.
Die nebenbei stattfindende Verbreitung eines betroffenen Werks, die sich ausschließlich als Konsequenz der Teilnahme an einer Peer-To-Peer-Datenübertragung ergibt,
um eine Kopie entgegennehmen zu können, erfordert ebenfalls keine Annahme dieser Lizenz. Jedoch gibt Ihnen nichts außer
dieser Lizenz die Erlaubnis, das Programm oder jedes betroffene Werk zu verbreiten oder zu verändern. Diese Handlungen verstoßen gegen das Urheberrecht,
wenn Sie diese Lizenz nicht anerkennen. Indem Sie daher ein betroffenes Werk verändern oder propagieren, erklären Sie Ihr Einverständnis mit dieser Lizenz,
die Ihnen diese Tätigkeiten erlaubt.
10. Automatische Lizensierung nachgeordneter Anwender

Jedesmal, wenn Sie ein betroffenes Werk übertragen, erhält der Empfänger automatisch vom ursprünglichen Lizenzgeber die Lizenz,
das Werk auszuführen, zu verändern und zu propagieren  in Übereinstimmung mit dieser Lizenz. Sie sind nicht dafür verantwortlich,
die Einhaltung dieser Lizenz durch Dritte durchzusetzen.

Eine "Organisations-Transaktion" ist entweder eine Transaktion, bei der die Kontrolle über eine Organisation oder das im wesentlichen gesamte Kapital einer solchen,
übertragen wird, oder sie ist die Aufteilung einer Organisation in mehrere oder die Fusion mehrerer Organisationen zu einer.
Wenn die Propagation eines betroffenen Werks durch eine Organisations-Transaktion erfolgt, erhält jeder an der Transaktion Beteiligte,
der eine Kopie des Werks erhält, zugleich jedwede Lizenz an dem Werk, die der Interessenvorgänger des Beteiligten hatte,
sowie das Recht auf den Besitz des korrespondierenden Quelltextes des Werks vom Interessenvorgänger,
wenn dieser ihn hat oder mit vertretbarem Aufwand beschaffen kann.

Sie dürfen keine zusätzlichen Einschränkungen bzgl. der Ausübung der unter dieser Lizenz gewährten oder zugesicherten Rechte vornehmen.
Beispielsweise dürfen Sie keine Lizenzgebühr oder sonstige Gebühr für die Ausübung der unter dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte verlangen,
und Sie dürfen keine Rechtsstreitigkeit beginnen (eingeschlossen Kreuz- oder Gegenansprüche in einem Gerichtsverfahren),
in der Sie unterstellen, daß irgendein Patentanspruch durch Erzeugung, Anwendung, Verkauf,
Verkaufsangebot oder Import des Programms oder irgendeines Teils davon verletzt wurde.
11. Patente

Ein "Kontributor" ist ein Urheberrechtsinhaber, der die Benutzung des Programms oder eines auf dem Programm basierenden Werks unter dieser Lizenz erlaubt.
Das auf diese Weise lizensierte Werk bezeichnen wir als die "Kontributor-Version" des Kontributors.

Die "wesentlichen Patentansprüche" eines Kontributors sind all diejenigen Patentansprüche, die der Kontributor besitzt oder kontrolliert,
ob bereits erworben oder erst in Zukunft zu erwerben, die durch irgendeine Weise des gemäß dieser Lizenz erlaubten Erzeugens,
Ausführens oder Verkaufens seiner Kontributor-Version verletzt würden. Dies schließt keine Patentansprüche ein,
die erst als Konsequenz weiterer Modifizierung seiner Kontributor-Version entstünden. Für den Zweck dieser Definition schließt "Kontrolle" das Recht mit ein,
Unterlizenzen für ein Patent zu erteilen auf eine Weise, die mit den Erfordernissen dieser Lizenz vereinbar ist.

Jeder Kontributor gewährt Ihnen eine nicht-exklusive, weltweite und gebührenfreie Patentlizenz gemäß den wesentlichen Patentansprüchen des Kontributors,
den Inhalt seiner Kontributor-Version zu erzeugen, zu verkaufen, zum Verkauf anzubieten, zu importieren und außerdem auszuführen, zu modifizieren und zu propagieren.

In den folgenden drei Absätzen ist eine "Patentlizenz" jedwede ausdrückliche Vereinbarung oder Verpflichtung, wie auch immer benannt,
ein Patent nicht geltend zu machen (beispielsweise eine ausdrückliche Erlaubnis, ein Patent zu nutzen oder eine Zusicherung,
bei Patentverletzung nicht zu klagen). Jemandem eine solche Patentlizenz zu "erteilen" bedeutet, eine solche Vereinbarung oder Verpflichtung zu beschließen,
ein Patent nicht gegen ihn durchzusetzen.

Wenn Sie ein betroffenes Werk übertragen, das wissentlich auf eine Patentlizenz angewiesen ist, und wenn der korrespondierende
Quelltext nicht für jeden zum Kopieren zur Verfügung gestellt wird  kostenlos, unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz und über
einen öffentlich zugänglichen Netzwerk-Server oder andere leicht zugängliche Mittel , dann müssen Sie entweder (1) dafür sorgen,
daß der korrespondierende Quelltext auf diese Weise verfügbar gemacht wird oder (2) dafür sorgen, daß Ihnen selbst die Vorteile
der Patentlizenz für dieses spezielle Werk entzogen werden oder (3) in einer mit den Erfordernissen dieser Lizenz vereinbaren Weise bewirken,
daß die Patentlizenz auf nachgeordnete Empfänger ausgedehnt wird. "Wissentlich angewiesen sein" bedeutet, daß Sie tatsächliches Wissen darüber haben, daß 
außer wegen der Patentlizenz  Ihre Übertragung des betroffenen Werks in einen Staat oder die Benutzung des betroffenen Werks durch Ihren Empfänger in einem Staat,
eins oder mehrere identifizierbare Patente in diesem Staat verletzen würden, deren Gültigkeit Ihnen glaubhaft erscheint.

Wenn Sie, als Folge von oder in Verbindung mit einer einzelnen Transaktion oder Vereinbarung, ein betroffenes Werk übertragen
oder durch Vermittlung einer Übertragung propagieren, und Sie gewähren einigen Empfängern eine Patentlizenz, die ihnen das Benutzen,
Propagieren, Modifizieren und Übertragen einer speziellen Kopie des betroffenen Werks gestatten, dann wird die von Ihnen gewährte
Patentlizenz automatisch auf alle Empfänger des betroffenen Werks und darauf basierender Werke ausgedehnt.

Eine Patentlizenz ist "diskriminierend", wenn sie in ihrem Gültigkeitsbereich die speziell unter dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte nicht einschließt,
wenn sie die Ausübung dieser Rechte verbietet oder wenn sie die Nichtausübung einer oder mehrerer dieser Rechte zur Bedingung hat.
Sie dürfen ein betroffenes Werk nicht übertragen, wenn Sie Partner in einem Vertrag mit einer Drittpartei sind,
die auf dem Gebiet der Verbreitung von Software geschäftlich tätig ist, gemäß dem Sie dieser Drittpartei Zahlungen leisten,
die auf dem Maß Ihrer Aktivität des Übertragens des Werks basieren, und gemäß dem die Drittpartei eine diskriminierende Patentlizenz all denjenigen gewährt,
die das Werk von Ihnen erhielten, (a) in Verbindung mit von Ihnen übertragenen Kopien des betroffenen Werks
(oder Kopien dieser Kopien) oder (b) hauptsächlich für und in Verbindung mit spezifischen Produkten oder Zusammenstellungen, die das betroffene Werk enthalten,
es sei denn, Sie sind in diesen Vertrag vor dem 28. März 2007 eingetreten oder die Patentlizenz wurde vor diesem Datum erteilt.

Nichts in dieser Lizenz soll in einer Weise ausgelegt werden, die irgendeine implizite Lizenz oder sonstige Abwehr gegen Rechtsverletzung ausschließt oder begrenzt,
die Ihnen ansonsten gemäß anwendbarem Patentrecht zustünde.
12. Keine Preisgabe der Freiheit Dritter

Sollten Ihnen (durch Gerichtsbeschluß, Vergleich oder anderweitig) Bedingungen auferlegt werden, die den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz widersprechen,
so befreien Sie diese Umstände nicht von den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz. Wenn es Ihnen nicht möglich ist,
ein betroffenes Werk unter gleichzeitiger Beachtung der Bedingungen in dieser Lizenz und Ihrer anderweitigen Verpflichtungen zu übertragen,
dann dürfen Sie als Folge das Programm überhaupt nicht übertragen. Wenn Sie zum Beispiel Bedingungen akzeptieren, die Sie dazu verpflichten,
von denen, denen Sie das Programm übertragen haben, eine Gebühr für die weitere Übertragung einzufordern, dann besteht der einzige Weg,
sowohl jene Bedingungen als auch diese Lizenz zu befolgen darin, ganz auf die Übertragung des Programms zu verzichten.
13. Nutzung zusammen mit der GNU Affero General Public License

Ungeachtet anderer Regelungen dieser Lizenz, ist es Ihnen gestattet, ein betroffenes Werk mit einem Werk zu einem einzelnen,
kombinierten Werk zu verbinden (linken) oder zu kombinieren, das unter Version 3 der GNU Affero General Public License steht,
und das Ergebnis zu übertragen. Die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz bleiben weiterhin auf denjenigen Teil anwendbar,
der das betroffene Werk darstellt, aber die speziellen Anforderungen der GNU Affero General Public License, §13,
die sich auf Interaktion über ein Computer-Netzwerk beziehen, werden auf die Kombination als solche anwendbar.
14. Überarbeitungen dieser Lizenz

Die Free Software Foundation kann von Zeit zu Zeit überarbeitete und/oder neue Versionen der General Public License veröffentlichen.
Solche neuen Versionen werden vom Grundprinzip her der gegenwärtigen entsprechen, können aber im Detail abweichen,
um neuen Problemen und Anforderungen gerecht zu werden.

Jede Version dieser Lizenz hat eine eindeutige Versionsnummer. Wenn in einem Programm angegeben wird,
daß es dieser Lizenz in einer bestimmten Versionsnummer "oder jeder späteren Version" ("or any later version") unterliegt,
so haben Sie die Wahl, entweder den Bestimmungen der genannten Version zu folgen oder denen jeder beliebigen späteren Version,
die von der Free Software Foundation veröffentlicht wurde. Wenn das Programm keine Versionsnummer angibt,
können Sie eine beliebige Version wählen, die je von der Free Software Foundation veröffentlicht wurde.
15. Gewährleistungsausschluß

Es besteht keinerlei Gewährleistung für das Programm, soweit dies gesetzlich zulässig ist.
Sofern nicht anderweitig schriftlich bestätigt, stellen die Urheberrechtsinhaber und/oder Dritte das Programm so zur Verfügung, "wie es ist",
ohne irgendeine Gewährleistung, weder ausdrücklich noch implizit, einschließlich  aber nicht begrenzt auf 
die implizite Gewährleistung der Marktreife oder der Verwendbarkeit für einen bestimmten Zweck. Das volle Risiko bezüglich Qualität und Leistungsfähigkeit
des Programms liegt bei Ihnen. Sollte sich das Programm als fehlerhaft herausstellen, liegen die Kosten für notwendigen Service, Reparatur oder Korrektur bei Ihnen.
16. Haftungsbegrenzung

In keinem Fall, außer wenn durch geltendes Recht gefordert oder schriftlich zugesichert, ist irgendein Urheberrechtsinhaber oder irgendein Dritter,
der das Programm wie oben erlaubt modifiziert oder übertragen hat, Ihnen gegenüber für irgendwelche Schäden haftbar,
einschließlich jeglicher allgemeiner oder spezieller Schäden, Schäden durch Seiteneffekte (Nebenwirkungen) oder Folgeschäden,
die aus der Benutzung des Programms oder der Unbenutzbarkeit des Programms folgen (einschließlich  aber nicht beschränkt auf  Datenverluste,
fehlerhafte Verarbeitung von Daten, Verluste, die von Ihnen oder anderen getragen werden müssen, oder dem Unvermögen des Programms,
mit irgendeinem anderen Programm zusammenzuarbeiten), selbst wenn ein Urheberrechtsinhaber oder Dritter über die Möglichkeit solcher Schäden unterrichtet worden war.
17. Interpretation von §§ 15 und 16

Sollten der o.a. Gewährleistungsausschluß und die o.a. Haftungsbegrenzung aufgrund ihrer Bedingungen gemäß lokalem Recht unwirksam sein,
sollen Bewertungsgerichte dasjenige lokale Recht anwenden, das einer absoluten Aufhebung jeglicher zivilen Haftung in Zusammenhang mit dem Programm am nächsten kommt,
es sei denn, dem Programm lag eine entgeltliche Garantieerklärung oder Haftungsübernahme bei.
ENDE DER LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN
